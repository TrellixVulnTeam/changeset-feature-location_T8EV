\begin{abstract}
Feature location is a program comprehension activity in which a developer
inspects source code to locate the classes or methods that implement a feature of interest.
Many feature location techniques (FLTs) are based on text retrieval models, and
in such FLTs it is typical for the models to be built from source code snapshots.
However, source code evolution leads to model obsolescence and
thus to the need to retrain the model from the latest snapshot.
In this paper, we introduce a topic-modeling-based FLT in which the model
is built incrementally from source code \emph{changesets}.
By training an online learning algorithm using changesets, the FLT
maintains an up-to-date model without incurring the non-trivial computational cost associated with retraining traditional FLTs.
We demonstrate the robustness of the new FLT via an empirical study of two popular text retrieval models:
latent semantic indexing and latent Dirichlet allocation.
Overall, we studied over 1200 defects and features from 14 open-source Java projects.
We also present a \emph{temporal simulation} in which we approximate how the FLT would perform throughout the evolution of a project.
%Our findings suggest that the performance of our FLT is similar to that of snapshot-based FLTs,
%but that it may not be suitable for use with fledgling projects.
