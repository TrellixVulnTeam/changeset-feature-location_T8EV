In this paper conducted a study on modeling the topics of changesets.
We used both latent semantic indexing (LSI) and latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA) to extract linguistic topics from changesets and
snapshots (releases).

We addressed two research questions regarding the topic modeling of changesets.

Future work includes deploying this appoach in a development environment.
Since the source to our approach is online, we encourage other researchers
to investigate this future work as well.
We also would like to expand the temporal parts of this study to include
both snapshots and changesets.
It would be particularly useful to compare results between batch snapshots and temporal snapshots.
Additional future work includes expanding our study to other systems,
particularly ones that are not Java.
It seems unlikely that our results are specific to Java systems,
though we cannot confirm this assumption without experimentation.
