I was able to recreate the scenario,I have a Java file in a Java project as /* * Created on Jun 8, 2004 * * TODO To change the template for this generated file go to * Window - Preferences - Java - Code Style - Code Templates */package com; import java.net.URL;import java.util.Date; /** * @author admin * * TODO To change the template for this generated type comment go to * Window - Preferences - Java - Code Style - Code Templates */public class Test {   Date xyz;   URL  abc;}  I open it in the editor, delete the keyword 'package' so that that line onlysays com. Now I right click on file and select 'Revert File'.  Notice that the imports list disappears. This is in M9.
