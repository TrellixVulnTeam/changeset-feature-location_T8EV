Here is the easy way to create this problem... 1. Create a new Workbench Window2. Show the Java Browsing -> Members View3. Select a different view4. Close the Workbench Window Both org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.actions.DebugDropDownAction and org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.actions.RunDropDownAction are not disposed. ActionPresentation doesn't clear out the invisibleBars. Much of the code could be cleaned up to avoid all the constant contains/get/remove sequence and just do a single remove instead.
