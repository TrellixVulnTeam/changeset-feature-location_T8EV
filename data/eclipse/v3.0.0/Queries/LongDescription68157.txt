RC3 - 20040622:00:10 I opened org.eclipse.ui.examples.jobs.views.JobsView added a field to theclasses saved the file (note at this point there are no errors or warnings inthe file) then clicked on another existing field and pressed CTRl+SHIFT+U. All Igot was a beep. I get this a lot and it is really annoying because I rely onthis search function, I love it!  The message in the status line when this happens is "element is not a javaelement".  So here are the exact steps to reproduce 100% of the time (note that I haveanalyse annotations while typing turned off):1. open JobsViews (org.eclipse.ui.examples.jobs plugin)2. click on userField attribute and ctrl+shirt+u works.3. add an attribute to the end of the Button fields. Don't save yet.4. Click on another attribute and ctrl+shirt+u. Beep. Nothing happens.4. save and the file compiles without errors.5. click on userField again and then ctrl+shirt+u. It no longer works and theabove error message is shown in the status line.  Closing and then opening the editor will get you out of this state. but this ishappening all the time and at first I thought it was a  keybinding problem, butit actually looks like a java search issue.
