RC2 1. have this folder structure: src // src folder|- encoding // package - encoding set to UTF-8    |- LATIN1Class.java // java source file, encoding: ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) Containing this code: ==================== package encoding; public class LATIN1Class {    /* (non-Javadoc)     * @see java.lang.Object#toString()     */    public String toString ( )    {        // TODO Auto-generated method stub        return ": " + ();    }     /**     * @return     */    private String  ( )    {        // TODO Auto-generated method stub        return "";    }}=========================== 2. Refactor -> Rename the class to LATIN1Class2 Expected: class is renamed, keeps encoding ISO-8859-1, file content the same butfor the class nameActual: class is renamed, keeps encoding ISO-8859-1, file content changed toUTF-8 encoding. Note:- When Refactor->Copying a class the file gets properly copied and saved in thefolder's encoding (UTF-8).- Rename is probably a special case of 'Move': a new file is created, with theinherited encoding. When renaming, the encoding should be kept.
