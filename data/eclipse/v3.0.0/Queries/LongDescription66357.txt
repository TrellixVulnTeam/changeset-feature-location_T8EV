I200406082000 1) start with an empty workspace2) create a simple project A3) create a file f.txt in A4) tranfer focus to the Navigator5) modify f.txt externally6) activate Eclipse without changing the active part7) press close box of editor open for f.txt -> A file changed dialog is posted by the editor. While the modal dialog is open, the editor gets closed. (see stack trace below) 8) press No in the dialog9) double click on f.txt to open it again -> nothing happens, no editor is opened (This is also the case when you have more files in the workspace and try to open an editor on some other file.) Observation: I see that the editor is created and its init method is called. I also see that its createPartControl method is not called. I haven't seen any thrown exception in the process of opening the editor.  Stack trace of how the original editor on f.txt gets disposed. I'd suspect that the problem is related to the fact the part is closed while its activation event is being processed.
