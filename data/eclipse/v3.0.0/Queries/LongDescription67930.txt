I200406190041 I wanted to rename the field "listeners" in the following code:  import java.util.EventListener;import javax.swing.event.EventListenerList; public class Test1 {    EventListenerList listeners = new EventListenerList();    public void addEventListener(EventListener eventListener) {        listeners.add(EventListener.class, eventListener);    }} Steps: - Trigger Rename Field Refactoring (using Ctrl-Shift-R) while Cursor is on"listeners"- Rename Field-Dialog opens- Type "ev" in "New Name" and trigger Code Assistant using "Ctrl-Space" Actual Result: A popup opens suggesting some field-names, *but* this popup is triggered on theeditor, and not on the dialog. If you press "Enter" to select a suggestion thefield is renamed to "ev", and the popup remains open. Expected Result: Popup closes and selection is inserted into the "New Name"-Field.
