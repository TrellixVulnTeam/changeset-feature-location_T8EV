Eclipse 200406111814 In the "Package Explorer" I have the following package hierarchy:   com     newco        [a bunch of java files and nested packages]     someco        nested          SomeClass.java        TestClass.java I selected "someco" and pressed "Delete" (the same thing happens when it's selected from the context menu) and the dialog asked me if I wanted to delete the "someco" package (as expected).  I selected "Yes" and "someco/TestClass.java" was deleted but "someco/netsted/SomeClass.java" remained.  I then had to explicitly select "someco.nested" and delete it. This appears to be inconsistent with selecting a "directory" (in this case a package) and deleting it. -- Separate but related issue --------------------------------------- I attempted to do the same thing again (to confirm the inconsistency) and this time I had "TestClass.java" opened in an editor and a changed made but not saved.  When I did the "someco" package delete again, "TestClass.java" was deleted (as previously) but nothing occurred in the editor window.  NOTE:  I had not switched the focus to the editor at this time!   Confused I selected "someco" again in "Package Explorer" and deleted it.  An error dialog appeared that read:    ...    [Working copy] TestClass.java [in com.comeco [in java [in java.XXX]]] does not exist I aborted in confusion.  I then selected "TestClass.java" in "PackageExplorer" and deleted it.  It appeared that nothing occurred.  (Again, note that I had not yet moved the focus to the open and unsaved editor.) When I finally did click on the editor, I received the dialog that asked me to save or close my file.  NOW I finally understood what was going on. Perhaps focus should have been shifted to the editor automatically after the delete so that I would have seen the dialog sooner.   I can imagine a less savvy (:-)) developer becomming befuddled by this problem and running away in terror! I should note that after I selected to close the unsaved file that the above inconsistency (where the nested package was not deleted) -did- occur. ------------------------- I encountered this while cleaning up the files I created for bug #66796 (Just a FYI on the package layout).  (I have both "Fold empty packages in hierarchical ..." and "Hierarchical" view selected.)
