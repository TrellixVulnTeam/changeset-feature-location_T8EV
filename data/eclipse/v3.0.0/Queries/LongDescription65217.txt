Build RC1. Sorry about all these nitty bug reports.  I'm doing screenshots of the two versions and can't help but notice these teenie differences.  In this case, "Preferences...".   As I understand the MS style guide, only dialogs that are part of a choice refinement have the ellipsis (as opposed to a "destination" dialog).  For example, "Properties" (no ellipsis since it is the goal, as it were) versus "Save As..." (only a step along the way to the goal).  In V2.x it was "Preferences" and now it is "Preferences..." so apparently someone had a change of heart.  Was this intentional? I won't claim to be an expert on the style guide, but I believe it was correct in V2.x to the best of my understanding.  Nick Edgar may have an opinion on this, or one of the other authors of the Eclipse UI Guidelines.
