When I copied text from the Java editor of an earlier Eclipse version (such as2.1 or 3.0M8) into the Windows clipboard and pasted it into a suitableapplication (such as MS Word), font and color (from syntax-highlighting)information was present. In M9, only the plain text is placed into the clipboard.
