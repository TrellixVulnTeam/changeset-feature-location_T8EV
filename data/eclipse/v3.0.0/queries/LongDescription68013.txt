Build: 3.0 RC3 I cannot reproduce this, but I got into a state where perspectives would no longer be visibly displayed. I could still open/close/switch/reset perspective, but they would never be visible. Ctrl+F7 could still toggle between views within that perspective, and status line contributions would still work. Roughly, here is what I did: 1) Started a brand new Eclipse workspace2) Went through the "Hello World" Java tutorial from the welcome page3) Went back to the Welcome page, and tested every link in "Overview", "Tutorials", and "What's New".4) Finally opened the "Samples" intro category5) Clicked to download the SWT examples6) Clicked yes on prompt to download from eclipse.org.7) A prompt came up asking if I wanted to reset the perspective. At the time, I had Java perspective open, and Resource perspective was also in my perspective tab group. I can't recall if I selected yes or no from this diaog.8) Clicked Finish on the sample download wizard -> Every perspective was now blank. Nothing in log or on Java console.
