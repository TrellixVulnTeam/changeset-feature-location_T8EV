I20040529 (RC1) I am using the perspective switcher to move between the Java and team perspectives.The top size diff object leaked:20 Composites (2K)4 CTabFolders (1K)9 CTabItems (1k)25 Rectanges (1k)...Totals about 10k per switch The leaks appear rooted in listeners to the mutable command manager of the DefaultViewPresentation. moving between other perspectives had similar characteristics. Some of the leaks may be duplication of bug 64614.
