type IWorkbenchPart and invoke content assist.  The perfect match "IWorkbenchPart" should be presented first.  Instead, you get:IWorkbenchPart2IWorkbenchPartConstantsIWorkbemchPartDescriptorIWorkbenchPart The first time I noticed this, I tried changing the "Present Proprosal in alphabetical order" preference.  It had no effect, so I shutdown and restarted Eclipse.  Now, if I *disable* this preference, the proposals are sorted alphabetically.  This is the opposite of what I would expect. BTW, why does this preference exist? It seems like proposal should *always* be alphabetized, with the only option being to group them such that variables come before class names.  But classnames should still be sorted in this case.
