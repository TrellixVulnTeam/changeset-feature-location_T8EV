Modules can't add elements to the UI
Before svn revision r13614, the modules were loaded after the UI, but the 
argouml team decided to load the modules before the UI (the model modules 
require that).

We must provide an API to module developers for adding elements (menubar, 
toolbar) to the ArgoUML UI.
